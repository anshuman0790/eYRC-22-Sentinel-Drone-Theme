# eYRC-22-Sentinel-Drone-Theme
 In this project, the drone was used to canvas the area of land while simultaneously scanning it using GPS in the real world and a ceiling mounted camera. With the help of path planning and pattern matching algorithm, the drone will detect the location of suspicious objects, estimate the coordinate system and send the data back to the main server.
